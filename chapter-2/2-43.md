## Exercise 2.43

In the original version of `queens`, `new-row` is added to `rest-of-queens` 8 times. This is a simple operation and should take a short time.

These combinations are then flatmapped on the recursive call to `queen-cols`, which recurses 8 times. We can assume the time to run each `queen-cols` call is significant and in the original it is called 8 times.

Louis Reasoner's version will run the recursive procedure `queen-cols` 8 times, which in turn will run the next recursive iteration 8 of `queen-cols` times, for 8 levels. This gives us $8^8$ times called.

If the original version takes time $T$, and

$$
T = 8x
$$

Of some cost $x$, then for Louis's version

$$
T' = 8^8x
$$

Therefore

$$
T' = 8^7T
$$

If we have $n$ queens instead of 8 queens and the original takes $T(n)$, Louis's version takes $O(n^{n-1}T(n))$.
