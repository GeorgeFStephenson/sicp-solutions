## Exercise 2.15

I originally wrote this:

>The errors originate from the use of `(/ 1.0 ...)` reciprocal procedures in `div-interval`. `par2` calls `div-interval` three times, indeed performing `div-interval` on the results of two calls to `div-interval` itself. For that reason, while `par1` and `par2` will both have errors, I expect `par2` will have larger error bounds.

However I was wrong because the implementation of `par2` is abstracted away from `div-interval`, so we can't blame `par2` for flaws with `div-interval`. 

What Eva Lu Ator is getting at is [the dependency problem in interval arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmetic#Dependency_problem). We are treating each interval as some uncertain number, and combining these uncertainties together with arithmetic creates bigger uncertainties and larger intervals. However if we are combining an interval with itself, the result should not become more uncertain than the original interval itself. This is the dependency problem where we might create more uncertainty by "counting" the same uncertainty twice.

So Eva is correct that `par2` is better arithmetically.
