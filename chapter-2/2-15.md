## Exercise 2.15

Eva Lu Ator in wrong. A variable, although uncertain at the time of writing the procedure to which it is passed as an argument, can be passed through without any error at all, for example as a primitive integer number.

The errors originate from the use of `(/ 1.0 ...)` reciprocal procedures in `div-interval`. `par2` calls `div-interval` three times, indeed performing `div-interval` on the results of two calls to `div-interval` itself. For that reason, while `par1` and `par2` will both have errors, I expect `par2` will have larger error bounds.
