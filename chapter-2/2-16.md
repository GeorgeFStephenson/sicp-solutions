## Exercise 2.16

In general, equivalent algebraic expressions may lead to different answers again due to [the dependency problem in interval arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmetic#Dependency_problem).

It is possible to compute the correct interval:

> If each variable appears only once and if $f$ is continuous inside the box. However, not every function can be rewritten this way.

We could devise a package that could prevent users from forming functions that cannot be rewritten so that each variable appears only once. Some functions will be impossible to rewrite, and some might be very difficult in practice. Preventing these could be better than giving the wrong answer, but the package would be incomplete. Perhaps even prevention is not always possible and we would need to raise an error.

To address the issue with errors in decimal numbers, one option is that you could devise a package that only dealt with intervals in terms of rational numbers, like the data structure we devised earlier, and only converted them into decimal numbers on printing. This is another way of saying that numbers must be represented without any errors.
